# :scroll: Basic Language

## What is this for? :mag:
In Structures of Programming Languages, we are using Python to create a mini-language that can perform a variety of actions.
- basic arithmetic
- function calls
- printing
- basic environment handling

and we slowly add more functionality as a group, while being responsible to add our own custom edititons.

We discuss about Formal Grammars like BNF and EBNF and apply these to our language. We break down languages down to basic components:
- Tokenizer
- Parser
- Evaluator
- Runner
